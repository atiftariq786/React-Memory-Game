#   React-Memory-Game
    :pen:This is a memory game app built using below mention technologies,The app should render 12 different images (of your choice) to the screen. Each image should listen for click events.The app should keep track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.
    Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.
    Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.

    This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## :computer: Code Description
    Create-react-app gives you a public folder with a basic index.html page, some basic css for the react template, an App.js file, index.js file, and some other boilerplate files. I only had to alter two things in the index.html page: the title of my app and include a Bootstrap CDN link. I either altered or completely changed the rest of the files, adding my own style. The bulk of the code for this app was done in the src/components directory.
